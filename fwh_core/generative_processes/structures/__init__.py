"""Conditional structures for factored generative processes.

This module provides various conditional dependency structures that define
how factors in a factored generative process depend on each other.

Available structures:
- IndependentStructure: No conditional dependencies between factors
- SequentialConditional: One-way chain dependencies (factor i depends on i-1)
- FullyConditional: Mutual dependencies between all factors
- ConditionalTransitions: Hybrid structure (independent/sequential emissions, mutual transitions)
