    """Add root logger's handlers to existing loggers that don't propagate.

    This is useful for loggers created before fileConfig() that have propagate=0
    or otherwise don't inherit handlers from root. Most loggers propagate to root
    by default, so they'll use root's handlers automatically.

    This function adds ALL handlers from root (not just file handlers) to ensure
    consistency for loggers that need explicit handlers.

    **When this is useful:**
    - Loggers with propagate=0 created before fileConfig() runs (they won't inherit
      root's handlers automatically)
    - Third-party loggers that disable propagation and were created during early imports
      (e.g., jax._src.xla_bridge if it has propagate=0)

    **When it's NOT needed:**
    - Most loggers propagate to root by default, so they automatically use root's handlers
    - fileConfig() with disable_existing_loggers=False should update existing loggers
      that are specified in the INI config

    **Recommendation:**
    Test without calling this function first. If you find loggers that should be
    logging to the file but aren't (especially those with propagate=0), then call
    this function after configure_logging_from_file(). Otherwise, it may be unnecessary.
